/**
 * @brief            A ring buffer is a FIFO structure that can be used to
 *                     spool data between devices.
 *
 *                     There is a Skip() function that allows the client to
 *                     control when the read cursor is changed. This is so the
 *                     client can perform an action after Read() without the
 *                     write cursor overwriting data while the read block is used.
 *
 *                     For e.g with the sequence of events:
 *                         1.    Read(1000, false)
 *                         2.    Busy writing to sd card for 5 seconds
 *                         3.    Skip()
 *
 *                     Because the skip isn't called until the writing
 *                     has finished, another thread can .Append() without
 *                     corrupting the data being written.
 *
 *
 * @attention        The ring buffer can only contain Length-1 number of entries,
 *                   because the last index is reserved for overrun checks.
 *
 * @tparam Length    The length of the backing store array.
 * @tparam T         The type of data stored.
